# SignGuy AI - Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Full-stack business management app for sign/graphics shops: customer management, quoting, invoicing, job tracking, production workflow, employee time tracking, payroll, webstores with Stripe-powered checkout, and AI-driven business assistance.

## Core Modules
- **CRM / Quotes / Invoices / Jobs** — standard business workflow.
- **Production Workflow** — job tickets, production tasks, drawings, signatures.
- **Employee Portal + Timeclock + Payroll** — punch tracking, shift state, payroll worksheets.
- **Webstores** — per-tenant storefronts, products, Stripe Checkout via Connect, orders → jobs.
- **AI Business Assistant** — Phase 5 (saved commands, routines, modes, bulk action previews).
- **Stripe Connect (platform-owned) + Stripe Connect (tenant onboarding)** — platform billing + tenant payouts.

## Implemented (CHANGELOG)

### 2026-04-22 — Stripe Connect mode-safety hardening
- Added `_scrub_stale_connect_account()` + `_is_wrong_mode_error()` helpers in `routes/stripe_connect.py`.
- `/stripe-connect/status` auto-scrubs test-mode Connect accounts lingering on a live platform and records audit trail (`stripe_connect_scrubbed_at/_reason/_account_id`).
- `/stripe-connect/create-account` refuses to save test-mode accounts on a live platform (defense in depth).
- `/stripe-connect/refresh-link` returns 409 with friendly copy when account is stale/wrong-mode, instead of a broken onboarding URL.
- `account_mode` detection now distinguishes `livemode=None` (unactivated live) from `livemode=False` (actual test) — fixes false `mode_mismatch` on fresh live accounts.
- Frontend `PaymentSettings.js` auto-refreshes status on 409 so UI recovers cleanly.
- Verified end-to-end: ghost `acct_1TP6Je0f4QWGY8c6` successfully scrubbed; live `acct_1TP6XF1JC1SdQUDo` recognized correctly.

### Earlier this session
- AI Business Assistant Phase 5 frontend integration.
- Webstore backend hardening (W1–W17): cross-tenant leaks, permission gaps, payout inflation, idempotency, Stripe caching, base64 image migration to object storage.
- Prelaunch checklist: 24 items tested and checked off.
- Timeclock display bug: canonical `clock_in` instead of `updated_at`.
- Dashboard clocked-in widget: removed UTC date regex (was dropping cross-midnight workers).
- Payroll print CSS: outline font stack fixed.
- `PayrollTransaction`: tenant_id scoping + Pydantic validation.
- Webstore frontend empty-state/filter-trap fix.
- Stripe Checkout Flow B rewrite — unified order recording into `webstore_orders_v2`, secure webhook handling, 9 bugs fixed.

## Roadmap (P0 → P3)

### P2 — Upcoming
- Easy Artwork sharing to Customer Portal from order details.
- AI receipt analysis for uploaded expense photos.

### P2 — Backlog
- Deduplicate payroll compensation snapshot hours (`_get_employee_compensation_snapshot` sums job+manual+clock without dedupe; needs product decision).

### P3 — Future
- Team / Workforce Ribbon rebuild (on hold).
- Optional: UI banner before Connect click reminding tenants to close old Stripe tabs.
